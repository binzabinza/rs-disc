It is okay. According to the Runescape wiki<...> items on the last day of advent calendar were the following tokens:
Christmas tree jumper
Party hat jumper
Glacial shieldbow
Santa claws
Santa paws
Source: Runescape wiki - Advent calendar (2019)
Considering those items have had significantly different prices since their release<...> it could tell us a little about ratios of those items in game (or rather in active market circulation). But it's not necessarily a definite rule.
Plus<...> as for the numbers<...> prices are for tokens which are tradeable. We need to take into account that certain share of players already claimed their tokens<...> but may still want to engage in trading the unclaimed tokens as an investment.

I'm not so sure there's a difference in rarity<...> the price difference initially I think may be due to demand. For example<...> a jumper with partyhats on it could be more in demand than a christmas tree one to the average player. It would be interesting though to compare rarity<...> but we would need a large sample size of rates of people receiving these tokens from TH. On several of my alt accounts<...> I was able to receive jumpers<...> and the santa paws token.
No doubt<...> the fact that many players have unlocked this token and some have forgotten about it likely has affected current demand. Time will tell<...> eh?

Seems like there was a wall at 400m<...> now that its been broken the price will rise quickly until the next wall is hit. Plague has definitely had a slower rise than assassin as its the third token<...> but I agree the 1.9b/440m discrepancy is rather large.

Theres more demand for Assassin I believe. Plague has been at 300-400m for a year or so now.

Seems like they have broken their wall. They were stuck at around 5-7m for months<...> now a recent purchase from GE was 21.5m... (Non Manip)<...> iv got a bunch so just curious on everyones thoughts..
10-Jun-2020 10:21:14, 1, 30, 9, Hard to say since we don't know how many tokens are in game I will expect a pause in price when the profit starts being too good. also the the sell walls on items are sometimes put on purpose so the Mercher can accumulate more at a cheaper price. Example: I will place an order to sell 100 tokens at 5m while at the same time buying in the 3m to 4m range every seller that wants to sell quick will be forced to sell under 5m. Walls don't always work<...> if there is real high demand for an item the mercher would be selling more tokens than buying in the lower range in that case they will most likely back off and the item will rise.

I'm just worried there are too many people invested in the item since we've now had two precedents for walk tokens. At the same time I thought assassin wouldn't rise over 500m (which is when I sold those too) because it also had a precedent in zombie walk. Guess we'll see<...> gl to those who still have them

If they don't re-release them price can keep rising<...> but if you look up conga tokens on RS Wiki it had said they cannot be obtained anymore but were still re-released. 
"Conga dance override token can no longer be obtained in RuneScape after an update but still exists in-game for those who had done so." - RS Wiki
So tokens are pure speculation in my opinion if you make money on your investment or not will be dependent on Jagex's actions.

if they were actually truly  discontinued they'd be price checked in the "Discontinued Item Status" thread.  and no your meaningless words prove nothing to what i was saying<...>

The re-release of conga made these a much riskier investment IMO<...> and definitely makes it hard to argue any SoF item is truly discontinued unless stated so by Jagex. Unlikely to re-enter the game anytime soon<...> sure<...> but still a possibility.  I understand why they're getting so expensive<...> but a decent amount of the demand still seems like people trying to merch them. At the same time I sold all my plagues literally right before this spike (fml) so what do I know

Walks like Conga and Loved up have already been re-released which in my opinion makes it a safer bet since Jagex might target other tokens that have not been re-released yet<...> to get the player base excited to buy more keys. I doubt they would want to run up the same promotion for the walks again It would not make much of a sense in terms of profit-making<...> but anything is possible so do your research and bet accordingly.

You were given some advice last week about your posts. You again posted a post that could be seen as trying to manipulate the prices. Please don't post it. Post was removed.
The purpose of this thread is to get an accurate recent price of Sof/Th tradable rares: 
It's not what You personally think the prices will be in a few weeks or a months time. No one can see into the future. So please keep the PC's to recent trades that people can follow and make use of. 
I or others could say Item X will be 10 billion by 2025. It's no use to todays Community. They are after Recent trades so they know they are getting the best deal.

Give it enough time and all token prices will go up if they are not released again. 
I have seen someone years ago when tree hat was released with about 2k tree hats and that is just 1 guy and look now<...> price is over 100m. 
Enough time for any rare is a higher price no matter how many were in the game as long item is not re released.

it's just that someone was trying to make people buy certain tokens by "predicting" they will skyrocket in near future.

I wonder how many pet of seasons tokens are going around these days. Are there any older discontinued tokens than crab hat and pos?
Older doesn't mean rarer<...> just look at the OG 2m fish mask. A few hundred POS are probably still circulating. Only reason they went up is because Easter Pets went up and people tagged along other pets like Seasons and Tribals to follow the trend.
IMO pet line could start looking like the Gem/Walk line in the future if people started to look into them more.
About the fish mask there was a glitch at one point that allowed any free player to claim one<...> which caused an influx of supply. I believe that is the reason they never really went up much.

Hot sand walks at that price puts oddments at a price of 3320gp each<...> that sure seems like a lot
Oddments put a cap on a lot of tokens<...> buying out the limited supply which causes the price to rise won't work anymore and oddments are not that hard to get. it will cause players to save up oddments just so they can buy the most expensive tokens and cash them by selling at GE causing an influx of supply. Just how I think it will turn out but I could be wrong.
I don't think these shops will be permanent. While they do provide a means for those items to enter the game temporarily (and with the token prices rising<...> it incentivizes people to purchase the most profitable tokens with oddments)<...> the prices should correct once the beach event is over. 
Personally<...> I think some tokens won't hit previous highs and some will likely reach new highs. Some tokens were likely consumed as a result of "advertisement" and new generated interest due to the return of the beach event. Some tokens have likely become incredibly saturated<...> due to people purchasing them with oddments. 
Time will tell where they'll settle. 
they're just using oddments to give everyone a equal one last chance to get any specific item they have wanted but could not buy with gp.
with a text like this put into a game npc<...> after the beach ends it will just depend on when/who/how quickly the items get touched.

If you think this is price manipulation<...> you may need to stop looking at the forums because 200m Defense is correct.
i can confirm i sold my stack at 500m now its just merchers trading each other till either someone outside of the circle buys them all or they stop trading each other and a few ppl have worthless tokens that no1 buys. on another note. if people think its a low volume item you got merched. thats all i am saying. if you think im wrong then your free to correct me. but i can assure you that there are more tokens than players buying them in the game. no joke. so if you dont want to risk it then play safe. also do your own research on it aswell to either confirm or decline what i wrote.
 
 
Really you sold a stack of plague doc walks for 500m each and decided not to post price checks when that happened or screen shots of a drop so big<...> yet now think this comment is proof enough. Nice try<...> actually no terrible try.

When the plague walks started there was an enormous amount that was when they were like 90m back in the day.
they increased in value because the quantity decreased which is obvious.
but logic sense. would a fashionscaper buy a token for 700m to redeem it and therefore lose the 700m. in some sense they would because dyes have a similar aproach but with dyes you can choose what weapon etc etc. but the walk is just the walk and thats it.
but to answer your question. i truly believe there are 2 to 3 times more plague walks than assasin/zombie walks ingame atm. i have no proof but seeing the legit trades from assasin and zombies vs the legit trades from plagues makes plague lose its quantity value in my opinion. thats also the reason i sold mine. note also that you will most likely see only a few people posting trades without screenshots and always the same players. to conclude this i will say it again. do your own research and dont spend money you cant affort to lose<...> you may either agree or disagree on what i write but this is what i see on the forum.

Oddments put a cap on a lot of tokens<...> buying out the limited supply which causes the price to rise won't work anymore and oddments are not that hard to get. it will cause players to save up oddments just so they can buy the most expensive tokens and cash them by selling at GE causing an influx of supply. Just how I think it will turn out but I could be wrong.
29-Jul-2020 13:28:51, 1, 154, 7, Its great that Jagex finally gave us the option to actually cash in oddments. I really hope events in this format are the new norm moving forward. There are way too many maxed accounts and alts<...> like this one<...> that dont care for xp or bulky cosmetics. I will personally be preparing oddments much better for the next time with the potential for token rereleases through an oddments format store.
Just wanted to give my quick appreciation post on this change in case any Jmod comes across this. Anyways no more off topic.

Hot sand walks at that price puts oddments at a price of 3320gp each<...> that sure seems like a lot
Oddments put a cap on a lot of tokens<...> buying out the limited supply which causes the price to rise won't work anymore and oddments are not that hard to get. it will cause players to save up oddments just so they can buy the most expensive tokens and cash them by selling at GE causing an influx of supply. Just how I think it will turn out but I could be wrong.
I don't think these shops will be permanent. While they do provide a means for those items to enter the game temporarily (and with the token prices rising<...> it incentivizes people to purchase the most profitable tokens with oddments)<...> the prices should correct once the beach event is over. 
Personally<...> I think some tokens won't hit previous highs and some will likely reach new highs. Some tokens were likely consumed as a result of "advertisement" and new generated interest due to the return of the beach event. Some tokens have likely become incredibly saturated<...> due to people purchasing them with oddments. 
Time will tell where they'll settle.

hello if someone could help me looking for PC estimate of last sale on these springfayre tokens   DANCER OUTFIT <...>   FACE PAINT  <...> HOOK-A-DUCK FLAIL <...>  VENTURER OUTFIT  <...>  i also have loads of the other ones but they have lower ge prices. thanks in advance
I have a spreadsheet I track token prices on. I'll share the google docs link. The last PC's were from yesterday and they are the last record I have from a transaction taking place. I don't track B or S because every sale has a buyer and a seller. Prices are from forums and trade chat.

Someone's hoarding all these bad bucky boys up seems like
Over long term<...> bucky's could defs go up even more<...> really depends what the hoarders do with the supply. Some of the old beach pets are 10-20m I think. The pet itself looks pretty decent.
